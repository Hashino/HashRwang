[chorus]
I'm an animal, inside of your skin
It feels like dying when you look at the edge

It feels like jumping in is the solution
To the problems we made in the way

[chorus]
I'm an animal, inside of your skin
It feels like dying not being close to your kin

I miss you kisses in the night alone
This cold feels like a dye to the bone
